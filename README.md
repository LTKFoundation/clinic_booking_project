## Direct Booking Medical Service

When your kid/pregnant wifey needs a checkup at local private clinics in Hanoi and Saigon. If your preferred Doctor is a well-known one, chances are you will have to come in really early to get a queue ticket. I used to wake up at 5am in the North's Winter just to travel to the clinic, get the ticket number, comeback home to pickup my wife and then return to the clinic around estimated timeslot for my number. If you come too early, you will be tired of the wait. If you are late, you will have to comeback in the afternoon session, and in some cases, you will have to get another queue number.
