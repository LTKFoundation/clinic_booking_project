====================================================================================================
Datkham.online is a Rails app that allows users to easily find clinics and doctors that is best suitable for their needs.
The key features of the system are:

1. UI target for best experience on mobile web
2. Location based content
3. Clean and Minimalist design => most relevant information with the least effort
4. Interactive rating system reflects quality of doctors and clinics services
5. Online Consultation booking system saves users' time
6. Helping doctors : better insight about their upcoming client, less reputation to gain more clients

Ultimately, the system aims to get rid of the hassle of coming directly to the clinic just to get the queue number ticket.
We also hope to reduce wait time at each clinic, everyone benefits from a less crowded clinic.
User doesn't have to spend hours waiting just to get a 5 minutes health check.
